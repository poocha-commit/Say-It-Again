# Say-It-Again
Not your normal translation app.
# say it again!

a super chill app that takes your plain text and turns it into pirate talk, yoda-speak, minion gibberish etc etc

## what is it?

just a little playground where you type stuff, pick a fun language, and watch it turn into a different text. 

## features

- built with node.js and express (the classic duo)  
- uses ejs for templating
- makes async calls with axios to the funtranslations.com api  
- multiple fun modes to keep you entertained  
- no database AGAIN!!!

## how to use

1. clone the repo  
2. run `npm install` 
3. start the app with `node index.js` or `nodemon index.js` 
4. open your browser to `localhost:3000`  
5. let the fun begin  

## why bother?

because normal text is overrated sometimes you just gotta yell something in minion language, you know?
